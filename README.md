# Rustychain
A simple CLI to simulate block mining on a blockchain, which in this case will not be disrtibuted or online, but will be one single blockchain.
When a new transaction is made, it is stored on a block, which will enter the chain when somebody mines it.

This project was built using the *Rust* programming language.

### Run the app
```
// run cargo to run the project
cargo run

// or build executable file
cargo build
```
